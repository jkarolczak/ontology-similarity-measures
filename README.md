# Measuring ontology concepts' similarity

## The project scope

This project aims to examine measuring similarity between concepts and individuals in ontologies. As a toolbox
owlready2 [1] is used.

The research began with research on existing measures [2, 3, 4, 5]. These measures can be split into three groups:

- <text>1.</text> Measures for concepts' similarity:
    - 1.1 Measures based only on the topological features of graphical representation of an ontology.
    - 1.2 Measures based on the topological features and information content of concepts.
- <text>2.</text> Measures for individuals' similarity.

The outcome of the project has been submitted to be presented as a poster during PP-RAI 2023.
